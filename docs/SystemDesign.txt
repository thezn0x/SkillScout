=================================
STEP 1: DESIGNING THE JOBS TABLE
=================================

Q1: What information do we need to store about EACH job?

1.Total Positions
2.Job Shift
3.Job Type
4.Job Location
5.Gender
6.Minimum Experience
7.Apply Before
8.Posting Date 
9.Job title
10.Company name
11.Min Salary
12.Max Salary
13.Platform
14.Benifits
15.Application Link
16.Description
17.Requirements

Q2: Which of these should be in the jobs table vs separate tables?
----

Item                    | In jobs table? | Separate table? | Why?
------------------------|----------------|-----------------|-------
Job title               |       yes      |                 |Cuz thats what this table is about and all the info related to job title is already present in jobs title
Company                 |                |      yes        |Because One company can have many job listings and it will be easier to track them and analyze them if they are in seperate table
Location                |                |      yes        |locations (location_id, city, country) jobs (existing) job_locations (job_id, location_id) <- junction
Salary                  |       yes      |                 |Because It does not need a table of its own and will cause conflict between different type of jobs
Skills required         |                |      yes        |Skills need 3 tables:- skills (skill_id, skill_name) - jobs (existing) - job_skills (job_id, skill_id) <- junction
Job type                |       yes      |                 |Because its not Something that needs definiton on its own
Posting Date            |       yes      |                 |Same as job type
Min Experience          |       yes      |                 |Also same as job type
Platform                |                |      yes        |If one job can be on multiple platforms -> many-to-many Need: platforms, jobs, job_platforms (junction)

Q3: How do we identify each job uniquely?
----
Option A: Auto-incrementing ID (1, 2, 3, 4...)
Option B: UUID (random unique identifier)

Which do you choose? : random unique identifier

Why? 
Because we will scrape a thousand jobs and giving each job a serial number does not make sense and is not scalable


Q4: What about jobs that appear on multiple sites?
----
Scenario: Same job appears on LinkedIn AND Rozee.pk

Do we:
[ ] Store it twice (2 separate records)
[ ] Store it once with multiple sources
[ ] Something else?

Your decision: Store once, track platforms => cleaner data
This system needs cleaner data because its not just a job board we need to analyze and process data to find out trends and
it also prevents redundance and will help the Ai agent to understand better

Detection: Compare title + company_id + salary range
If match within 5% => same job and just add to job_platforms

Q5: How do we track if a job is still active?
----
A job gets posted today, might be closed next week.

How do we know?
Option A: is_active boolean (true/false)
Option B: closed_date timestamp (NULL if still open)
Option C: Both

Your choice: A
Why: It shows clarity without complexity

================================
STEP 2: DESIGNING OTHER TABLES
================================

TABLE 1: COMPANIES
------------------
Purpose: Store unique companies that post jobs

Columns I need:
- company_id: UUID (PK)
- name: TEXT (UNIQUE)
- industry: TEXT (e.g., "Technology", "Finance", "Healthcare")
- size: TEXT (e.g., "1-10", "11-50", "51-200", "201-500", "500+")
- location: TEXT (headquarters location)
- website: TEXT
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
- updated_at: TIMESTAMP

Questions:
Q: Do I need all these fields for MVP?
Decision: Yes and its not just an MVP we're building a production grade system

Q: Should industry be separate table or TEXT?
Decision: seperate ->, for analytics Purpose and market trends

TABLE 2: SKILLS
---------------
Purpose: Master list of all skills

Columns I need:
- skill_id: UUID (PK)
- skill_name: TEXT (UNIQUE) (e.g., "Python", "React", "Docker")
- category: TEXT (e.g., "backend", "frontend", "devops", "data")
- created_at: TIMESTAMP  <= I don't think we need this

Questions:
Q: Should category be separate table?
Decision: Yes as we cannot add a new category if there is no skill in that category right now because it will cause dependency which is bad for Normalizatio

Q: How do I handle skill aliases? (JavaScript = JS = javascript)
Options:
  A) Store all variations ("JavaScript", "JS", "javascript")
  B) Normalize during extraction (always store as "JavaScript")
  C) Add aliases table
Decision: B, Because its the most effecient way and makes much more sense 


TABLE 3: PLATFORMS
------------------
Purpose: Track which job boards we scrape from

Columns I need:
- platform_id: UUID (PK)
- platform_name: TEXT (UNIQUE) (e.g., "rozee", "linkedin", "indeed")
- base_url: TEXT (e.g., "https://rozee.pk")
- is_active: BOOLEAN (are we currently scraping this platform?)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP

Questions:
Q: Do I need is_active field?
Decision: No because we are scraping fixed amount of top level websites


TABLE 4: LOCATIONS
------------------
Purpose: Track cities/countries

Columns I need:
- location_id: UUID (PK)
- city: TEXT (e.g., "Karachi")
- country: TEXT (e.g., "Pakistan")
- created_at: TIMESTAMP

OR should I make it simpler?
- location_id: UUID (PK)
- location_name: TEXT (e.g., "Karachi, Pakistan")

Questions:
Q: Separate city/country or combined?
Decision: Seperate as it will help us understand which job is in which country because manually doing it is a pain in the ass but are we making it too complex at this point?


TABLE 5: JOB_SKILLS (Junction)
-------------------------------
Purpose: Link jobs to skills (many-to-many)

Columns I need:
- job_id: UUID (FK -> jobs.job_id)
- skill_id: UUID (FK -> skills.skill_id)
- is_required: BOOLEAN (required vs nice-to-have?)
- experience_level: TEXT (e.g., "2+ years", "Expert", NULL)
- PRIMARY KEY (job_id, skill_id)

Questions:
Q: Do I need is_required and experience_level for MVP?
Decision: Yeah we need it but experience_level will be as 1, 2, 0.6, 3 means in years not in phrases and is required will be again helpful in analyzing trends


TABLE 6: JOB_PLATFORMS (Junction)
----------------------------------
Purpose: Link jobs to platforms (many-to-many)

Columns I need:
- job_id: UUID (FK -> jobs.job_id)
- platform_id: UUID (FK -> platforms.platform_id)
- source_url: TEXT (link to original job posting)
- scraped_date: TIMESTAMP (when we found it)
- PRIMARY KEY (job_id, platform_id)

Questions:
Q: Any other fields needed?
Decision: This looks complete


TABLE 7: JOB_LOCATIONS (Junction)
----------------------------------
Purpose: Link jobs to locations (many-to-many)

Columns I need:
- job_id: UUID (FK -> jobs.job_id)
- location_id: UUID (FK -> locations.location_id)
- PRIMARY KEY (job_id, location_id)

Questions:
Q: Any other fields needed?
Decision: this looks complete


SUMMARY: TABLES NEEDED FOR MVP
-------------------------------
List all tables:
1. jobs
2. companies
3. skills
4. platforms
5. locations
6. job_skills (junction)
7. job_platforms (junction)
8. job_locations (junction)

Total: 8 tables

Do I need any other tables for MVP?
Decision: Trending(job and skill)? Should we think about it?


INDEXES NEEDED
--------------
For fast queries, which columns should be indexed?

jobs table:
- [ ] jobs.company_id (for "all jobs from company X")
- [ ] jobs.posted_date (for "jobs this month")
- [ ] jobs.is_active (for "active jobs only")
- [ ] jobs.salary_min, jobs.salary_max (for salary range queries)

job_skills table:
- [ ] job_skills.skill_id (for "all jobs needing skill X")
- [ ] job_skills.job_id (for "all skills for job Y")

Other indexes needed:
