## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.14 or higher
- PostgreSQL database
- Node.js (for Playwright dependencies, usually handled by pip)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/thezn0x/SkillScout.git
cd SkillScout
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
playwright install chromium
```

### 4. Database Setup
1. Create a PostgreSQL database.
2. Execute the `schema.sql` file to create the necessary tables:
```bash
psql -h localhost -U your_username -d your_database -f schema.sql
```

### 5. Configuration
1. Copy `config/.env.example` to `config/.env`.
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` and other environment variables in `config/.env`.

## 🚀 Usage

The ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline is split into three main stages:

### 1. Extraction
Run the scrapers to fetch raw job data from supported platforms:
```bash
python scripts/run_extractors.py
```
*Extracted data is typically saved as JSON files in a configured output directory.*

### 2. Transformation
Clean and normalize the extracted data:
```bash
python scripts/run_transformers.py
```
*This stage handles deduplication, salary parsing, and skill extraction.*

### 3. Loading
Load the cleaned data into the PostgreSQL database:
```bash
python scripts/run_loaders.py
```

## 📊 Database Schema

SkillScout uses a normalized PostgreSQL schema to ensure data integrity and efficient querying:

- **jobs:** Core table for job posting details.
- **companies:** Unique list of hiring organizations.
- **skills:** Master list of technical and soft skills.
- **locations:** Standardized cities and countries.
- **platforms:** Job boards where data is sourced from.
- **Junction Tables:** `job_skills`, `job_platforms`, and `job_locations` manage many-to-many relationships.

Refer to `schema.sql` for the full DDL.

## Future updates (coming gradually)

- **Apache Airflow:** Adding Apache AirFlow to schedule the pipeline.
- **Analytics:** Adding analytics to make it actually helpfull.
